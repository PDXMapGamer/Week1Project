TEST README
This github repo will be used for my week 1 project.


Relfections for the week 1 project:
Overall I am very satisfied with the outcome of my first project.

I believe I have satisfied all the main requirements and all the example stretch requirements as well.

Although I acheived everything I wanted to do for this project I did run into the same bug multiple times,
it was caused when I was editing code elements or an entire section randomly dissapears, I quickly solved this bug by using inspect element in my browser and see that the element either somehow got a width or heigh of 0, making them invisible, so this bug was easily solved by manually giving the elements a width and height.

While styling if I ended up struggling to figure out how to get it to go where I want it to I would check inspect element and look at the box model diagram and it quickly lets me see what is causing the elements to move around in funky ways mainly due to it having margins I did not expect from other parts of my css code or it had them by default.

There main thing for me to improve on is trying to get myself to focus on the project, as it ended up taking longer due to me being distracted and procrastinated on putting the finishing touches (however 90% of the requirements had already been done by saturday lunch) which caused minor aesthetic flaws such as white background on brand logos and I also want to tweak the stylings of the page to make it look better, however I don't have enough time to completely correct these flaws.
